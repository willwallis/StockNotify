## Overview
Google App Engine application to notify user by email / SMS / phone if a stock reaches a set price limit.

## Motivation
Moved overseas and was working hard so couldn't keep constant eye on stocks. Didn't want to set limit orders but did want to know if stocks moved outside set ranges.

## Usage
Needs to be uploaded to Google App Enginge to work. Written in Python 2.7 with Jinja2 templates. Makes use of Bootstrap for UI elements.
Using the SMS and phone elements will require a Twillio API key which you can request online.
